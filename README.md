> a simple scaffolding to start publishing your react components to npm, Enjoy !

its simple, just clone this repo, go to package.json a,d webpack.config.js files and update whats in ***<>*** with yours.

***the /src folder will contain your ```js``` files, and the /src/assets folder will contain your styles.***

if you want to test your components locally, just create a react app ***named demo*** with CRA. and then run this command

```bash
npm run devpack
```

you should see the react app running, go ahead and play with, import your component there, and test it.

Good luck !!
